# Loot Patcher

## ü™ÑIntroduction

This mod is mainly made for modpacks and is used to inject new loots into existing loot tables.

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration

### The initial configuration file looks like:

```
{
  "patches": []
}
```

This mod is configured via the `config/loot-patcher.json` file. By default, this mod will not inject any loot tables.

This mod is compatible with ModMenu, which you can install in order to configure the mod in-game via the configuration screen. After modifying the config you will need to reload the datapack (in-game by typing the `/reload` command) to apply the changes.

## üìúExample Usage

It is obvious that there should be no ellipses or comments in the JSON format file, and this case is only for the sake of explanation.

### Configuration file:
#### ```loot-patcher.json```

```
{
	"patches": [
	    {
		    "target_tables": [
			    "minecraft:chests/ancient_city",
			    "^(?!.*xxx).*entities.*" //Support regular expressions.
			],
		    "extra_tables": [
			    "xxx:entities/common_drop",
			    "xxx:entities/rare_drop"
			]
	    },
	    {
		    "target_tables": ...
		    "extra_tables": ...
		},
		...
	]
}
```

### Consequence

The above configuration indicates that two loot pools will be added to the loot table with ID `minecraft:chests/ancient_city` and to all loot tables with IDs that contain `entities` but not `xxx`, with the only loot entry in the pools being those of the loot table type (`xxx:entities/ common_drop` and `xxx:entities/rare_drop`).

## üö®Warning

You should try to avoid infinite loops in the loot table during the configuration process.

~~Even if you don't, there won't be any serious consequences...~~

```
{
  "patches": [
    {
      "target_tables": [".*"],
      "extra_tables": ["minecraft:entities/zombie"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, the target loot tables include the extra tables. If you kill a zombie, the zombie's loot table will attempt to drop itself, which causes infinite recursion.
