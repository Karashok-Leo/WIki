## ü™öRecipe

### New Recipe Type

This mod adds a recipe type (`fusion-smithing:smithing_fusion`). The JSON file for a single recipe is as follows:

```
{
  "type": "fusion-smithing:smithing_fusion",
  "template": {
    "item": "fusion-smithing:fusion_smithing_template"
  },
  "base": {
    "tag": "c:boots"
  },
  "addition": {
    "tag": "c:boots"
  }
}
```

The `template` field is the forge template used for the recipe (placed in the template slot, but can be any item, not necessarily a template);
The `base` field is the source item for the NBT data transfer;
The `addition` field is the target item for the NBT data transfer.

### Default Recipes

This mod adds some default recipes, in the form of the example recipe above, containing the tags:

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration

### The initial configuration file looks like:

```
{  
  "injected_loot_table": "minecraft:chests/end_city_treasure"
}
```

If you don't want the template to appear in the treasure chest of the End City, you can modify the "injected_loot_table" entry to another loot table, or just leave it blank.

### How to adapt to more items?

Just create a datapack to add new recipes.
